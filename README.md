**Building Low-Resource African Language Corpora: Extending Existing Kidaw’ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo Datasets**

This project extends the open-source dataset created by Audrey Mbogho, Quin Awuor, Andrew Kipkebut, Lilian Wanzare, and Vivian Oloo, as detailed in their work on building corpora for the under-resourced Kenyan languages Kidaw’ida, Kalenjin, and Dholuo. 

The original dataset can be accessed here:

## Goal

- To expand parallel translations of existing datasets to additional African languages, thereby enriching linguistic diversity and supporting broader NLP research and application development.

## Approach

At the outset of this project, the dataset lacked an English translation. To overcome this:

1. **Initial Translation:** We translated the Dholuo dataset into English using a pretrained machine translation model, leveraging linguistic expertise available within our team.

2. **Expert Review:** Dholuo-English bilingual language experts then reviewed and corrected the initial translations to ensure accuracy and quality.

3. **Further Translation:** Using the verified English translations as a pivot language, we translated the dataset into additional African languages within our expertise.

4. **Validation:** Language experts for each respective language reviewed and validated these translations.

5. **Public Availability:** Validated datasets are published on HuggingFace for open and public use.

## Disclaimer

- The datasets available in this repository represent initial machine-generated translations. They have **not yet been validated by language experts**.
