# Project Tasks

## Overview
Three issues have been created in this repository that need to be managed using GitHub Actions.

## Requirements
Your task is to implement GitHub Actions workflows that will:

1. Fetch and process repository issues
2. Extract start dates and end dates from issue content
3. Automatically post comments on issues based on timeline triggers

## Implementation Details
The workflow should:
- Query the GitHub API to retrieve issue data
- Parse issue content to identify project dates
- Post automated reminder comments according to the schedule
- Handle error cases gracefully

## Testing Instructions
Before submitting a pull request:
1. Fork this repository to your account
2. Test the workflow thoroughly in your forked repository
3. Verify that comments are being posted correctly
4. Document any issues or edge cases discovered

## Next Steps
We will review your implementation during our team meeting on Monday, May 19th. Please come prepared to:
- Demo your solution
- Discuss your implementation approach
- Share any challenges encountered
- Suggest potential improvements
